# Disable Flyway during unit/integration tests to avoid startup failures
# caused by Flyway attempting to load a JDBC driver before the test classpath
# is prepared. This keeps tests fast and isolated. If you later want
# migrations during tests, switch to a real DB (testcontainers) and enable Flyway.
